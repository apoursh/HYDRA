# Deployment of HyDRA with Azure cloud services.

Both the clients and the server use Azure Resource Managers (ARM) templates to deploy the cloud resources. 

The ARM deploys an Ubuntu VM (and associated storage) with HyDRA image loaded. After deployment, the user can connect to the VM with SSH. 

For further instructions follow the folder corresponding to your role (Analysis center = hub, data provider = spoke).
